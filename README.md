# Programming Practice
This repository has been created for myself to recall the basics of datastructures & algorithms.
I would like to share the code files with the programming community, feel free to make changes and run the code

Datastructures related code goes into ```utilities.c``` file.

For compiling the code related to datastructures,

```console
foo@bar:~$ gcc -o filename filename.c path/to/utilities.c -I path/to/utilities.h-directory
```
For compiling graph related code, do the following

```console
foo@bar:~/programming-practice/graphs $ gcc -o Graph Graph.c ../utilities.c -I ../
```
